# Time_series_analysis
Overview
This project aims to compare two prominent stock analysis methods: Time Series Analysis and Fundamental Analysis, specifically applied to Apple Inc. We utilized Seasonal Auto-Regressive Moving Average (SARIMA) and Prophet models for Time Series Forecasting and Intrinsic Valuation for Fundamental Analysis.

Time Series Analysis
Time Series Analysis uses historical patterns and seasonality to predict future values by developing mathematical models that capture the series. The models used in this project are:

Seasonal Auto-Regressive Moving Average (SARIMA)
Prophet
Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental Analysis is based on economic foundations, financial reports, and researching various business/industry aspects. It involves analyzing financial ratios, balance sheets, and the domestic & global business environments. The goal is to determine whether a security is undervalued or overvalued. In this project, we employed Intrinsic Valuation.

Time Series Forecasting

Models Used:

SARIMA (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)

Prophet

Result Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
R2 Score

Problem Solved
We developed mathematical models that capture the historical patterns and seasonality in Apple Inc.'s stock prices to forecast future values.

Fundamental Analysis
Approach
We conducted a thorough analysis of Apple Inc.'s financial health using various financial ratios and metrics, alongside examining the business environment both domestically and globally.

Result Metrics:
Overvalued or Undervalued

Actionable Insight
Based on the findings from both analyses, we provide insights on whether to invest in Apple Inc.'s stock.
